Running order to reproduce the results in the article


First:

yeast_smetana_adjustment -> Adjusts exchange reaction and metabolite IDs of the fungal models to the namespace of bacterial CarveMe models to be suitable as input for SMETANA.

adjust_fungal_models_smetana -> Adjusts exchange reaction and metabolite IDs of the fungal models to the namespace of bacterial CarveMe models to be suitable as input for SMETANA.


Second:

smetana_preparation -> Makes a dataframe in which GEMs are grouped in communities. It would
be the input for SMETANA calculations.

media_preparation -> Makes a union of the media (essentials + SC defined media) to ensure that all the CarveMe models grow for the sake of SMETANA analysis.

smetana_random_communities -> Make dataframe of communities of three, four, and five members (random selection with and without fungal models) as input for SMETANA.

exchanged_metabolites_genes -> Makes the content of the Suppl table including FVA analysis and gene-reaction associations in GEMs.


Third:

smetana_run -> Runs the main SMETANA analysis in complete and SC media.

smetana_run_rand_comms -> Runs the random SMETANA analysis.


Last:

plots -> plots all the result figures.
